He&lt;Dre&gt; has had enough.SOMEONE&lt;Cheng&gt; glares.His friends grab him.Glaring, SOMEONE&lt;Cheng&gt; shakes them off.SOMEONE&lt;Cheng&gt; faces the fallen American boy.who looks up, his face grimacing helplessly.SOMEONE&lt;Cheng&gt; lunges with a punch, but a hand grabs his wrist.SOMEONE&lt;Han&gt; bends SOMEONE&lt;Cheng&gt;'s hand down and in toward the wrist.He&lt;Han&gt; stares at the boy.He&lt;Han&gt; shoves SOMEONE&lt;Cheng&gt; back into his group of friends.SOMEONE&lt;Cheng&gt; gapes.SOMEONE&lt;Han&gt; crouches to SOMEONE&lt;Dre&gt;.Two of SOMEONE&lt;Cheng&gt;'s older cohorts step forward. He&lt;Cheng&gt; stops them.then advances on  SOMEONE&lt;Han&gt; himself.He&lt;Cheng&gt; delivers a kick, but  SOMEONE&lt;Han&gt; intercepts his ankle.The man lifts SOMEONE&lt;Cheng&gt;'s leg, then shoves him back.As SOMEONE&lt;Cheng&gt; falls, one of the other boys attacks.SOMEONE&lt;Han&gt; deftly blocks every strike.Two boys' fists fly toward  SOMEONE&lt;Han&gt;'s face, and he&lt;Han&gt; bends backwards evading them.SOMEONE&lt;Han&gt; waits in a fighting stance, his wrists crossed in an X shape.He&lt;Han&gt; blocks a strike and holds a tall boy against his body.As a younger boy kicks,  SOMEONE&lt;Han&gt; blocks the attack with the tall boy.He&lt;Han&gt; pulls the young kicker in, uses him as a shield against the tall boy.then flips the younger into a trash barrel.SOMEONE&lt;Cheng&gt; and the others rush SOMEONE&lt;Han&gt;, who deflects their blows.
