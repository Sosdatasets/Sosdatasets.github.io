Lizzie gazes up at the portrait.It's a likeness of Darcy, staring proudly out at them.Outside, Darcy has now taken off his frock coat.He lays it on the grass, sits on it, and undoes his cravat.His dark hair curls with sweat.Then he unbuttons his waistcoat and slips it off.Inside, Lizzie is still gazing up at his portrait.Darcy stands at the very edge of the lake, now in just his breeches and loose, white shirt.Steeling himself, he dives in.He plunges down into the murky, green waters, then begins to swim with long, effortless strokes.Lizzie is now admiring the formal gardens.Darcy is striding towards Pemberley, his wet shirt clinging to his broad chest.His groom leads the horse behind him.The groom goes off in one direction, Darcy in the other.He emerges from the trees, into a field filled with buttercups.He makes his way down the hill, towards the large lake fronting Pemberley, its classic lines reflected in the still waters.Lizzie is also making her way down to the lake, lost in thought.She turns to see Darcy striding out of the woods towards her.Darcy stops dead in his tracks.He bows, then continues on his way just as the Gardiners come down the hill towards Lizzie, who's looking a little unsettled.Darcy hurries down some steps into the courtyard, quickly pulling on his coat.He pauses for a moment, trying to decide which direction to go.Then, he marches off through an archway, where he catches up with Lizzie.He walks off and Mrs. Gardiner takes Lizzie's arm.They set off after Darcy and Mr. Gardiner, who are walking a few paces ahead.
