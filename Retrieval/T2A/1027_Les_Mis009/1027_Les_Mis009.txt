Now on foot, Javert marches along an alleyway.As Javert searches along dark alleyways, Valjean climbs to the top of a wall.Cosette watches fearfully as Valjean struggles.Using the rope, he hauls her up beside him.They lie still along the top of the wall.Javert is below them.He walks off.Valjean lowers Cosette on the rope on the other side of the wall.He climbs down himself and carries Cosette.They peer into a chapel.The interior is lit by the golden glow of candlelight.A group of nuns are singing.Holding Cosette, Valjean turns and sees a man with a spade.The stout, scruffy balding man throws down his spade and takes off his hat.They go with Fauchelevant.High up on a tower, Javert stands facing an ornate cross.He closes a Bible and walks out to a ledge overlooking Paris.Beside him is a huge stone eagle.The tower rises up behind Javert to a spire with a cross on top.Standing in the corner of the wasteland where the Bastille stood is a giant elephant, a model Napoleon had constructed in preparation for a monument.It now stands dowdy and decaying.A scruffy, ratty-haired urchin climbs out of a hole in the elephant's head.A number of urchins climb out of the elephant and slide down ropes.They run across the wasteland.They run through a restaurant stealing food.
