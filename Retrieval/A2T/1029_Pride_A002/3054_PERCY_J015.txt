SOMEONE<Luke> throws a dagger.It slices off one of SOMEONE<Percy>'s wings.The hero plummets, losing his grip on the bolt.It tumbles toward a rooftop with a glowing skylight.He<Percy> weakly pushes himself up on all fours.The bolt.Eyeing a water tower behind SOMEONE<Luke>, SOMEONE<Percy> shuts his eyes.The SOMEONE<villain> grins smugly.He<Luke> takes aim.Turning, SOMEONE<Luke> sees water jet from its splitting seams.The tank's cap flies off and its contents gush out in a swirling arc.Another vat nearby bursts open and the two streams converge.SOMEONE<Percy> unleashes water from two more tanks, and it all combines to form a giant flowing barrier around the rooftop.The son of Poseidon holds the water at bay on either side of himself.SOMEONE<Percy> flings his hands forward.The SOMEONE<villain> fires, but the water rushes in at him.It douses the charge and engulfs him.Energy crackles within the swirling mass.The maelstrom tosses SOMEONE<Luke> about like a toy and the bolt wrenches from his grasp.Water evaporates in the nighttime air.SOMEONE<Percy> bends over, resting his hands on his knees.Water rises to form a trident in the hero's hand.Catching the SOMEONE<villain> around the throat it sends him flying out into a river.SOMEONE<Luke>'s winged sneakers flap uselessly beside it.SOMEONE<Percy> carries the bolt in one hand and his sword in the other as he<Percy> lands on the observation deck.
